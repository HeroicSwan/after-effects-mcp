# After Effects MCP

**A production-minded Model Context Protocol server for Adobe After Effects.**

Headless Startup bridge · sync tool calls · hybrid high-level tools + JSX escape hatch · composition frame capture as images · resources & prompts for agents.

Build motion graphics, review cuts, and render YouTube-ready projects from an MCP client while keeping After Effects as the execution environment.

## Features

- **Headless by default** — no “open panel + Auto-run” required
- **Sync-feeling RPC** — tools wait for AE (request IDs, timeouts, clear errors)
- **Motion tools** — comps, layers (text/shape/solid/null/camera…), keyframes, expressions, effects
- **Vision** — `ae_capture_frame` returns a PNG still so agents can verify work
- **Resources** — `ae://project`, `ae://docs/*`
- **Prompts** — lower-third, kinetic type, debug comp
- **Companion skill** — `skills/after-effects-mcp/SKILL.md`
- **Editorial planning** — sentence-aware cut scoring, explainable EDLs, clean/retention/story modes, YouTube structure, chapters, and b-roll/graphic suggestions
- **Quality workflow** — multi-frame QA, saved preview reviews, approve/reject decisions, and autonomous or approval-gated builds
- **Motion system** — reusable brand-aware hook, lower-third, chapter, statistic, quote, subscribe, and end-screen templates
- **One-shot motion videos** — canonical blueprints, visual grammar, coherence validation, deterministic scene builds, multi-frame QA, repair passes, and approval-aware previews
- **Export presets** — automatic MP4, MOV, and PNG render presets with explicit output paths
- **Body-cam workflow** — local reference analysis, transcripts, editor-style evidence, structured edit plans, and post-render YouTube-readiness scoring

## Requirements

- Adobe After Effects **2022+**
- Node.js **20+**
- AE preference: **Edit → Preferences → Scripting & Expressions → Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network**

## Connection model (important)

| When | What you do |
|------|-------------|
| **One-time setup** | `install-bridge`, enable scripting file/network access, open AE once |
| **Day-to-day** | Leave **After Effects open**. Only restart the **AI client** (Grok / Claude / Cursor) |
| **If tools go quiet** | AI client restart is enough — MCP auto-kicks the bridge into running AE. Or run `ae-mcp ensure` |

You should **not** need to restart After Effects every time you reconnect the AI.

How it works: when the MCP server starts (AI client launch), it runs `AfterFX.exe -r ae-mcp-ensure.jsx` against the **already open** AE session, restarts the headless poller, and a watchdog re-kicks if heartbeats die.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeroicSwan/after-effects-mcp.git ae-mcp
cd ae-mcp
npm install
npm run build
npm run install-bridge
```

If AE was already open during install, restart AE **once** so Startup bootstrap loads. After that, only restart the AI client.

```bash
npm run health
# or force reconnect without touching AE:
node dist/index.js ensure
```

## MCP client config

### Claude / Cursor / generic

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ae-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/Users/YOU/Projects/ae-mcp/dist/index.js", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Grok / Codex / Claude Code

Point the MCP server command at `node` + absolute path to `dist/index.js` with arg `serve`.

The After Effects panel can write the Codex entry directly into `C:\Users\YOU\.codex\config.toml`. Restart Codex after installing it.

### ChatGPT

ChatGPT uses a remotely reachable HTTPS MCP endpoint rather than launching this local Windows stdio command directly. Select **ChatGPT (remote MCP)** in the After Effects panel to create `~/.ae-mcp/chatgpt-setup.json` and a setup guide. Set `AE_MCP_CHATGPT_MCP_URL` before setup if you already have an authenticated HTTPS relay. Never expose the local bridge without authentication.

## CLI

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ae-mcp serve` | MCP stdio server (default) |
| `ae-mcp health` | Check live bridge / AE |
| `ae-mcp install-bridge` | Copy Startup bootstrap into AE script folders |

## Typical agent workflow

1. `ae_health`
2. `ae_create_composition` / `ae_get_composition`
3. `ae_create_layer` → `ae_set_keyframes` / `ae_set_expression` / `ae_apply_effect`
4. `ae_capture_frame` — **look at the still**
5. Iterate

## Tool catalog (v0.1)

| `ae_get_layer` / `ae_create_layer` / `ae_set_layer_properties` | Layers |
| `ae_duplicate_layer` / `ae_delete_layer` | Layer ops (`confirm` for delete) |
| `ae_set_keyframes` / `ae_set_expression` | Animation |

## Architecture

```
MCP client → ae-mcp (stdio) → in-process broker → ~/.ae-mcp/instances/<id>/
                                                     command.json → result.json
                                              ← AE Startup bootstrap.jsx
```

## Development

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm run typecheck
```

## Body-cam analysis and output evaluation

The [`bodycam-analysis/`](bodycam-analysis/) subsystem turns raw and reference
media into structured evidence for the After Effects MCP. It inventories and
transcribes footage locally, separates likely editor-added narration from source
audio, measures cuts and dead time, and generates reviewable JSON contracts.

After an edit is rendered, its evaluator measures technical delivery, audio,
pacing, and opening structure. An editorial review then scores hook quality,
story clarity, polish, and documentary context. Privacy, graphic violence,
factual grounding, and media rights remain hard publish gates.

```bash
cd bodycam-analysis
python scripts/full_analysis.py "C:\path\reference-video.mp4"
python scripts/evaluate_output.py "C:\path\finished-edit.mp4"
```

See [the body-cam analysis guide](bodycam-analysis/README.md) for the data
layout, generated artifacts, and final-score workflow.
